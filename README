Synth: Scrolls as you play (PennApps Fall 2013, Top 20)

Instrument players! Ever wish you didn't have to turn pages while playing? Synth listens to you and scrolls along as you play. No page turning required.

Run setAudioSource.m to find the ID of your input audio source, set micID in synth.m to that, and then run synth.m

Here is a screen-recorded demo using audio input from youtube. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYDT7QZ2P2w

Note that this was largely a proof-of-concept as opposed to a finish product. As such, everything was written mostly from scratch in MATLAB, and there's no way to input your own music yet.  If you are interested in turning this into a finished product, drop me an email. 


Features:
1) Can recognize where you are in real-time
2) Remembers everything you've played so far, so that repeats later on in the music do not cause problems
3) Can detect silence and clear its memory, allowing you to start from anywhere in the piece again

Team members:
Justin Yim (signal processing, hardware input)
Kevin Shi (pattern recognition, sheet music generation)
Gaby Moreno-Cesar (frontend)


Details of the algorithm can be found in synth.pdf
